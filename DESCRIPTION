Description: A powerful, easy to write and easy to modify syntax for
    specifying and estimating Partial Least Squares (PLS) path models allowing for the latest estimation methods
    for Consistent PLS as per Dijkstra & Henseler (2015, MISQ 39(2): 297-316), adjusted interactions as per 
    Henseler & Chin (2010) <doi:10.1080/10705510903439003> and bootstrapping utilizing 
    parallel processing as per Hair et al. (2017, ISBN:978-1483377445).

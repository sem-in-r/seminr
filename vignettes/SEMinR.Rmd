## Introduction

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = T, comment = "#>")
library(seminr)
```

SEMinR brings many advancements to creating and estimating structural equation models (SEM) using Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM):

* A _natural_ feeling, _domain-specific_ language to build and estimate structural equation models in R
* Uses _variance-based PLS estimation_ to model both _composite_ and _common-factor_ constructs
* _High-level functions_ to quickly specify interactions and complicated structural models

SEMinR follows the latest best-practices in methodological literature:

* Automatically _adjusts PLS estimates to ensure consistency (PLSc)_ wherever common-factors are involved
* Ajusts for known biases in interaction terms in PLS models
* Continuously tested against leading PLSPM software to ensure parity of outcomes: SmartPLS (Ringle et al., 2015) and ADANCO (Henseler and Dijkstra, 2015), as well as other R packages such as semPLS (Monecke and Leisch, 2012) and matrixpls (Rönkkö, 2016)
* _High performance, multi-core_ bootstrapping function

Briefly, there are four steps to specifying and estimating a structural equation model using SEMinR:

1. Describe measurement model for each construct and its items:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Distinguish and mix composite or reflective (common-factor) measurement models
measurements <- constructs(
  composite("Image",       multi_items("IMAG", 1:5), weights = mode_B),
  composite("Expectation", multi_items("CUEX", 1:3), weights = mode_A),
  reflective("Loyalty",    multi_items("CUSL", 1:3))
)
```

2. Specify any interactions between constructs:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Easily create orthogonalized or scaled interactions between constructs
intxns <- interactions(
  interaction_ortho("Image", "Expectation")
)
```

3. Describe the structural model of causal relationships between constructs (and interactions):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Quickly create multiple paths "from" and "to" sets of constructs
structure <- relationships(
  paths(from = c("Image", "Expectation", "Image*Expectation"), 
        to = "Loyalty")
)
```

4. Put the above elements together to estimate and bootstrap the model:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Dynamically compose SEM models from individual parts
pls_model <- estimate_pls(data = mobi, measurements, intxns, structure)
summary(pls_model)

# Use multi-core parallel processing to speed up bootstraps
boot_estimates <- bootstrap_model(pls_model, nboot = 1000, cores = 2)
summary(boot_estimates)
```

SEMinR seeks to combine ease-of-use, flexible model construction, and high-performance. Below, we will cover the details and options of each of the four parts of model construction and estimation demonstrated above.

## Setup

You must install the SEMinR library once on your local machine:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("seminr")
```

And then load it in every session you want to use it:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(seminr)
```

## Data

You must load your data into a dataframe from any source you wish (CSV, etc.). Column names must be names of your measurement items.

*Important:* Avoid using asterixes '*' in your column names (these are reserved for interaction terms).

For demonstration purposes, we will start with a dataset bundled with the seminr package - the `mobi` data frame (also found  in the `semPLS` R package). This dataset comes from a measurement instrument for the European Customer Satisfaction Index (ECSI) adapted to the mobile phone market (Tenenhaus et al. 2005).

You can see a description and sample of what is in `mobi`:

```{r}
dim(mobi)
head(mobi)
```

## Measurement model description

SEMinR uses the following functions to describe measurement models:

* `constructs()` gathers all the construct measurement models
* `composite()` or `reflective()` define the measurement mode of individual constructs
* `multi_items()` or `single_item()` define the items of a construct

These functions should be natural to SEM practitioners and encourages them to explicitly specify their core nature of their measurement models: composite or common-factor (See Sarstedt et al., 2016, and Henseler et al., 2013, for clear definitions).

Let's take a closer look at the individual functions.

### Create measurement model matrix with `constructs()`

`constructs()` compiles the measurement model source-target matrix from the user specified construct descriptions described in the parameters. You must supply it with any number of individual _composite_ or _reflective_ constructs:

```{r}
mobi_mm <- constructs(
  composite("Image",         multi_items("IMAG", 1:5), weights = mode_B),
  composite("Expectation",   multi_items("CUEX", 1:3), weights = regression_weights),
  composite("Quality",       multi_items("PERQ", 1:7), weights = mode_A),
  composite("Value",         multi_items("PERV", 1:2), weights = correlation_weights),
  reflective("Satisfaction", multi_items("CUSA", 1:3)),
  reflective("Complaints",   single_item("CUSCO")),
  reflective("Loyalty",      multi_items("CUSL", 1:3))
)
```

We are storing the measurement model in the `mobi_mm` variable for later use.

Note that neither a dataset nor a structural model is specified in the measurement model stage, so we can reuse the measurement model object `mobi_mm` across different datasets and structural models.

### Describe individual constructs with `composite()` or `reflective()`

`composite()` or `reflective()` describe a construct and its items.

For example, we can use `composite()` to describe mode A (correlation weights) for the "Expectation" construct with manifest variables CUEX1, CUEX2, and CUEX3:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
composite("Expectation", multi_items("CUEX", 1:3), weights = mode_A)
# is equivalent to:
composite("Expectation", multi_items("CUEX", 1:3), weights = correlation_weights)
```

We can describe composite "Image" using mode B (regression weights) with manifest variables IMAG1, IMAG2, IMAG3, IMAG4 and IMAG5:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
composite("Image", multi_items("IMAG", 1:5), weights = mode_B)
# is equivalent to:
composite("Image", multi_items("IMAG", 1:5), weights = regression_weights)
```

Alternatively, we can use `reflective()` to describe the reflective, common-factor measurement of the "Satisfaction" construct with manifest variables CUSA1, CUSA2, and CUSA3:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
reflective("Satisfaction", multi_items("CUSA", 1:3))
```

### Specifying construct measurement items

SEMinR strives to make specification of measurement items shorter and cleaner using `multi_items()` or `single_item()`

* `multi_items()` creates a vector of multiple measurement items with similar names
* `single_item()` describe a single measurement item

We can describe the manifest variables: IMAG1, IMAG2, IMAG3, IMAG4 and IMAG5:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
multi_items("IMAG", 1:5)
# which is equivalent to the R vector:
c("IMAG1", "IMAG2", "IMAG3", "IMAG4", "IMAG5")
```

`multi_items()` is used in conjunction with `composite()` or `reflective()` to describe a composite and common-factor construct respectively.

We can describe a single manifest variable CUSCO:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
single_item("CUSCO")
# which is equivalent to the R character string:
"CUSCO"
```

It is important to note that a single-item constructs can be defined as either composite mode A or reflective common-factor, but single-item constructs are essentially composites whose construct scores are determined.

## Interaction terms

Creating interaction terms by hand can be a time-consuming and error-prone. SEMinR provides high-level functions for simply creating interactions between constructs.

* `interactions()` gathers all pairs of interacting constructs in the model
* `interaction_ortho()` or `interaction_scaled()` specify individual pairs of interactions

Note that recent studies show PLS models must adjust the standard deviation of the interaction term because: _"In general, the product of two standardized variables does not equal the standardized product of these variables"_ (Henseler and Chin 2010). SEMinR automatically adjusts for this providing highly accurate model estimations.

### Describe all model interactions with `interactions()`

`interactions()` describes all pairs of interactions in a model.

```{r}
mobi_xm <- interactions(
  interaction_ortho("Image", "Expectation"),
  interaction_ortho("Image", "Value")
)
```

The object held in `mobi_xm` is:

```{r}
mobi_xm
```

Not that these functions themselves return functions that are not resolved until passed as a parameter to the `estimate_pls()` function for model estimation.

### Describe an interaction with `interaction_ortho()` or `interaction_scaled()`

`interaction_ortho()` describes a single interaction composite generated by the orthogonalization method of Henseler and Chin (2010).

`interaction_scaled()` describes a single interaction composite as generated by the scale product-indicator method as described by Henseler and Chin (2010).

For both these methods the standard deviation of the interaction term is adjusted as noted above.

For example, we can describe the following interactions between antecedent and moderator:
* "Image" + "Value"

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Orgthogonalized interaction between "Image" x "Expectation"
interaction_ortho("Image", "Expectation")

# Scaled (mean-centered, standardized) interaction between "Image" x "Value"
interaction_scaled("Image", "Value")
```

These functions themselves return functions that are not resolved but passed as parameters to the `interactions()` function discussed above.

**Important Note:** SEMinR syntax uses an asterix "*" as a naming convention for the interaction construct. Thus, the "Image" + "Expectation" interaction is called "Image*Expectation" in the structural model below. Please refrain from using an asterix "*" in the naming of non-interaction constructs.

## Structural model description 

SEMinR makes for human-readable and explicit structural model specification using these functions:

* `relationships()` gather all the structural relationships between all constructs
* `paths()` specifies relationships between sets of antecedents and outcomes

### Create structural model with `relationships()`

`relationships()` compiles the structural model source-target matrix from the user specified structural path descriptions described in the parameters.

For example, we can describe a structural model for the `mobi` data:

```{r}
mobi_sm <- relationships(
  paths(from = "Image",        to = c("Expectation", "Satisfaction", "Loyalty")),
  paths(from = "Expectation",  to = c("Quality", "Value", "Satisfaction")),
  paths(from = "Quality",      to = c("Value", "Satisfaction")),
  paths(from = "Value",        to = c("Satisfaction")),
  paths(from = "Satisfaction", to = c("Complaints", "Loyalty")),
  paths(from = "Complaints",   to = "Loyalty")
)
```

Note that neither a dataset nor a measurement model is specified in the structural model stage, so we can reuse the structural model object `mobi_sm` across different datasets and measurement models.

### Describe structural paths with `paths()`

`paths()` describe single or multiple structural paths between sets of constructs.

For example, we can define paths from a single antecedent construct to a single outcome construct:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# "Image" -> "Expectation"
paths(from = "Image", to = "Expectation")
```

Or paths from a single antecedent to multiple outcomes:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# "Image" -> "Expectation"
# "Image" -> "Satisfaction"
paths(from = "Image", to = c("Expectation", "Satisfaction"))
```

Or paths from multiple antecedents to a single outcome:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# "Image" -> "Satisfaction"
# "Expectation" -> "Satisfaction"
paths(from = c("Image", "Expectation"), to = "Satisfaction")
```

Or paths from multiple antecedents to a common set of outcomes:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# "Expectation" -> "Value"
# "Expectation" -> "Satisfaction"
# "Quality" -> "Value"
# "Quality" -> "Satisfaction"
paths(from = c("Expectation", "Quality"), to = c("Value", "Satisfaction"))
```

Even the most complicated structural models become quick and easy to specify or modify.

## PLS SEM Model Estimation

SEMinR can estimate a full SEM model described by the measurement and structural models above:

* `estimate_pls()` estimates the inner and outer parameters of a SEM model using PLSPM algorithms

This function takes the following parameters:

* `data`: the dataset containing the measurement model items specified in `constructs()`
* `measurement_model`: the measurement model described by the `constructs()` function
* `interactions` (optional): the interactions described by the `interactions()` function (default is NULL)
* `structural_model`: the structural model described by the `paths()` function
* `inner_weights`: the weighting scheme for path estimation - either `path_weighting` for path weighting (default) or `path_factorial` for factor weighting (Lohmöller 1989)
* `max_iterations` (optional): the maximum number of iterations (default is 300)
* `stop_criterion` (optional): the number of places of precision to stop at (default is 7) 

For example, we can estimate a simple PLS SEM model adapted from the structural and measurement model with interactions described thus far:

```{r}
# define measurement model
mobi_mm <- constructs(
  composite("Image",        multi_items("IMAG", 1:5)),
  composite("Expectation",  multi_items("CUEX", 1:3)),
  composite("Value",        multi_items("PERV", 1:2)),
  composite("Satisfaction", multi_items("CUSA", 1:3))
)

# specify interactions among constructs
mobi_xm <- interactions(
  interaction_ortho("Image", "Expectation"),
  interaction_ortho("Image", "Value")
)

# define structural model
# note: interactions cobnstruct should be named by its main constructs joined by a '*'
mobi_sm <- relationships(
  paths(to = "Satisfaction",
        from = c("Image", "Expectation", "Value",
                 "Image*Expectation", "Image*Value"))
)

mobi_pls <- estimate_pls(data = mobi,
                         measurement_model = mobi_mm,
                         interactions = mobi_xm,
                         structural_model = mobi_sm,
                         inner_weights = path_weighting)
```

### Consistent PLS (PLSc) for common-factors

Dijkstra and Henseler (2015) offer an adjustment to generate consistent weight and path estimates of common factors estimated using PLSPM. SEMinR automatically adjusts for consistent estimates of coefficients for common-factors defined using `reflective()`.

Note: SEMinR does adjust for PLSc on models with interactions involving common-factors. Models with interactions can be estimated as PLS consistent, but are subject to some bias as per Becker et al. (2018). In small sample sizes, bootstrapping such a PLSc model with interactions can cause errors.

## Bootstrapping the model for significance

SEMinR can conduct high performance bootstrapping.

* `bootstrap_model()` bootstraps a SEMinR model previously estimated using `estimate_pls()`

This function takes the following parameters:

* `seminr_model`: a SEM model provided by `estimate_pls()`
* `nboot`: the number of bootstrap subsamples to generate
* `cores`: If your pc supports multi-core processing, the number of cores to utilize for parallel processing (default is NULL, wherein SEMinR will automatically detect and utilize all available cores)

For example, we can bootstrap the model described above:

```{r}
# use 1000 bootstraps and utilize 2 parallel cores
boot_mobi_pls <- bootstrap_model(seminr_model = mobi_pls,
                                 nboot = 1000,
                                 cores = 2)
```

1. `bootstrap_model()` returns an object of class `boot_seminr_model` which contains the following accessible objects:
    + `boot_seminr_model$boot_paths` an array of the `nboot` estimated bootstrap sample path coefficient matrices
    + `boot_seminr_model$boot_loadings` an array of the `nboot` estimated bootstrap sample item loadings matrices    
    + `boot_seminr_model$boot_weights` an array of the `nboot` estimated bootstrap sample item weights matrices    
    + `boot_seminr_model$boot_HTMT` an array of the `nboot` estimated bootstrap sample model HTMT matrices
    + `boot_seminr_model$paths_descriptives` a matrix of the bootstrap path coefficients and standard deviations
    + `boot_seminr_model$loadings_descriptives` a matrix of the bootstrap item loadings and standard deviations
    + `boot_seminr_model$weights_descriptives` a matrix of the bootstrap item weights and standard deviations
    + `boot_seminr_model$HTMT_descriptives` a matrix of the bootstrap model HTMT and standard deviations

Notably, bootstrapping can also be meaningfully applied to models containing interaction terms and readjusts the interaction term (Henseler and Chin 2010) for every sub-sample. This leads to slightly increased processing times, but provides accurate estimations.

## Reporting the PLS SEM Model

### Reporting the estimated `seminr_model` 

There are multiple ways of reporting the estimated model. The `estimate_pls()` function returns an object of class `seminr_model`. This can be passed directly to the base R function `summary()`. This can be used in two primary ways:   

1. `summary(seminr_model)` to report $R^{2}$, adjusted $R^{2}$, path coefficients for the structural model, and the construct reliability metrics $rho_{C}$ (Dillon and Goldstein 1987), AVE (Fornell and Larcker 1981), and $rho_{A}$ (Dijkstra and Henseler 2015)

```{r}
summary(mobi_pls)
```

2. `model_summary <- summary(seminr_model)` returns an object of class `summary.seminr_model` which contains the following accessible objects:
    + `model_summary$iterations` reports the number of iterations to converge on a stable model
    + `model_summary$paths` reports the matrix of path coefficients, $R^{2}$, and adjusted $R^{2}$
    + `model_summary$reliability` reports composite reliability ($rho_{C}$), average variance extracted (AVE), and $rho_{A}$
    + `model_summary$cross_loadings` reports all possible loadings between contructs and items
    + `model_summary$loadings` reports the estimated loadings of the measurement model
    + `model_summary$weights` reports the estimated weights of the measurement model
    + `model_summary$composite_scores` reports the construct scores of composites
    + `model_summary$vif_items` reports the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for the measurement model
    + `model_summary$vif_antecedents` report the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for the structural model
    + `model_summary$descriptive_stats` reports the descriptive statistics and correlations for both items and constructs

Please note that common-factor scores are indeterminable and therefore construct scores for common factors are not reported (Hair et al.,2011).

### Reporting the bootstrapped `boot_seminr_model` 

As with the estimated model, there are multiple ways of reporting the bootstrapped model. The `bootstrap_model()` function returns an object of class `boot_seminr_model`. This can be passed directly to the base R function `summary()`. This can be used in two primary ways:   

1. `summary(boot_seminr_model)` to report t-values and p-values for the structural paths

```{r}
summary(boot_mobi_pls)
```

2. `boot_model_summary <- summary(boot_seminr_model)` returns an object of class `summary.boot_seminr_model` which contains the following accessible objects:
    + `boot_model_summary$nboot` reports the number of bootstraps performed
    + `model_summary$t_values` reports the matrix of t_values for path co-efficients
    + `model_summary$p_values` reports the matrix of p_values for path co-efficients

### Reporting confidence intervals for direct and mediated bootstrapped structural paths with `confidence_interval()`

The `summary(boot_seminr_model)` function will return p_values and t_values for direct structural paths. However,
the `confidence_interval()` function can be used to evaluate the confidence intervals for specific paths - direct and mediated (Zhao et al., 2010) - in a `boot_seminr_model` object returned by the `bootstrap_model()` function.

This function takes the following parameters:

* `boot_seminr_model`: a bootstrapped SEMinR model returned by `bootstrap_model()`
* `from`: the antecedent construct for the structural path
* `to`: the outcome construct for the structural path
* `through`: the mediator construct, if the path is mediated (default is NULL)
* `alpha` the required level of alpha (default is 0.05)

and returns a specific confidence interval using the percentile method as per Henseler et al. (2014).

```{r}
mobi_mm <- constructs(
composite("Image",        multi_items("IMAG", 1:5)),
composite("Expectation",  multi_items("CUEX", 1:3)),
composite("Quality",      multi_items("PERQ", 1:7)),
composite("Value",        multi_items("PERV", 1:2)),
composite("Satisfaction", multi_items("CUSA", 1:3)),
composite("Complaints",   single_item("CUSCO")),
composite("Loyalty",      multi_items("CUSL", 1:3))
)
# Creating structural model
mobi_sm <- relationships(
 paths(from = "Image",        to = c("Expectation", "Satisfaction", "Loyalty")),
 paths(from = "Expectation",  to = c("Quality", "Value", "Satisfaction")),
 paths(from = "Quality",      to = c("Value", "Satisfaction")),
 paths(from = "Value",        to = c("Satisfaction")),
 paths(from = "Satisfaction", to = c("Complaints", "Loyalty")),
 paths(from = "Complaints",   to = "Loyalty")
)
# Estimating the model
mobi_pls <- estimate_pls(data = mobi,
                        measurement_model = mobi_mm,
                        structural_model = mobi_sm)
# Load data, assemble model, and bootstrap
boot_seminr_model <- bootstrap_model(seminr_model = mobi_pls,
                                    nboot = 50, cores = 2, seed = NULL)

# Calculate the 5% confidence interval for mediated path Image -> Expectation -> Satisfaction
confidence_interval(boot_seminr_model = boot_seminr_model,
                   from = "Image",
                   through = "Expectation",
                   to = "Satisfaction",
                   alpha = 0.05)

# Calculate the 10% confidence interval for direct path Image -> Satisfaction
confidence_interval(boot_seminr_model = boot_seminr_model,
                   from = "Image",
                   to = "Satisfaction",
                   alpha = 0.10)
```

### Reporting data descriptive statistics and construct descriptive statistics with `summary(seminr_model)`

The `summary(seminr_model)` function will return four matrices:
`model_summary <- summary(seminr_model)` returns an object of class `summary.seminr_model` which contains the following four descriptive statistics matrices:
    + `model_summary$descriptive_stats$item_descriptives` reports the descriptive statistics for items
    + `model_summary$descriptive_stats$item_correlations` reports the correlation matrix for items
    + `model_summary$descriptive_stats$construct_descriptives` reports the descriptive statistics for constructs
    + `model_summary$descriptive_stats$construct_correlations` reports the correlation matrix for constructs

```{r}
model_summary <- summary(mobi_pls)
model_summary$descriptive_stats$item_descriptives
model_summary$descriptive_stats$item_correlations
model_summary$descriptive_stats$construct_descriptives
model_summary$descriptive_stats$construct_correlations
```
